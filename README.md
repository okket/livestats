This is the coffeefied code from the very nice Peepcode screencast [Meet Node.js](https://peepcode.com/products/nodejs-i). 

Works for me. Your mileage may vary. Use at your own risk.

Usage
-----

    coffee -c -b .
    node run_dev_server.js

Now open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` and the stat api like `http://127.0.0.1:8000/stat?ip=24.18.211.123&title=Bacon`

All hail the Great Grosenbach! Or Hypno Toad!
